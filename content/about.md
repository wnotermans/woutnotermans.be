My name is Wout Notermans, I'm a math student and computer nerd from Belgium. My main interests are computational and applied mathematics, with an additional focus on programming and optimization. I'm also a musician and have been playing the [*euphonium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphonium) for almost my entire life. I mainly listen to eurobeat, video game OST and jazz, but I'm also a big fan of old-time musicals like *Singin' In The Rain*. I mainly [program](/projects) in [Python](https://www.python.org/), but I'm also interested in learing [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) which is known for its extreme speed.
